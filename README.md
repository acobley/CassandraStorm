CassandraStorm
==============
A very much cutdown version of the storm-starter project to demo writting to a cassandra cluster:

https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/tree/master/examples/storm-starter

This just uses the RandomSentence Spout,  a Randomletter Spout, the ExclamationSpout.

A Saver bolt is added that writes to a cassandra cluster
